# Adtech Click Prediction

train.csv and test.csv contain a subset of attributes from impression logs for an online advertising campaign. 

Each row in train.csv includes a “response” column indicating a success label of “1” or “0”. Your task is to use machine learning techniques to compute the probabilities of a “1” label for each row in test.csv. 

Your output should be a file containing a column of numbers with probabilities of a response for every row of the test.csv.
